READ before listening! When I thought about the story that I wanted to tell through sounds it didn’t come to mind instantly. I love to write songs and poems that tell a story that you can feel or resonate with in some way, shape, or form. We are all in college, so why not use my college experience to make sounds that tell a story not everyone is familiar with? Did you start college living in a dorm and walking to class or did you live at home and drive to campus? My entire college experience has been as a commuter, two years living at home and 2 years living off-campus at Pitt. When listening to my sound I want you to be able to experience a feeling that brings back memories. How did you feel on your first day of college? My soundscape includes a day in the life of a college commuter. When thinking about sounds to use for this, I envisioned all the steps of my day and came up with the sounds I wanted to use from there. I went through my routine and thought about how I could keep the listener engaged while going through my day. The most exciting aspect of my soundscape process was being able to tell whatever story you wanted. There were no specific guidelines to use certain sounds or follow a specific vision, I was able to tell my story in my own way. While there have been technical challenges that I have faced such as, finding specific sounds, lining up the tracks to not run into each other, and using sound effects to name a few. In life, there are always challenges that we overcome, and this project helped me to express myself in a new and riveting way. Now, close your eyes, press play, and enjoy the ride.
