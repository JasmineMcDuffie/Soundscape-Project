As I continue to work on my project I am adding more sounds to go along with my story.
I have added an alarm sound which is from my phone and added other sounds from free sound.
Those include a car starting and traffic as if you were a commuter on campus. 
I will continue to add sounds to complete the story as a day in the life as a student commuter.
